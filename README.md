# ü§ó Transformers Agent UI

THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY A PROOF OF CONCEPT. DON'T EXPECT EVERYTHING TO WORK! CHECK OUT THE
[TODO LIST](#todo-list) FOR MORE INFO.

We want to

- Make it easy to use the [Hugging Face Transformers Agent](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/transformers_agents).

We provide

- the `TransformersAgentUI` component which can be used in the notebook as a web app
- a deployment of the web app on Hugging Face Spaces

You can install and use the package as simple as.

```bash
pip install transformers-agent-ui
```

In a notebook just run

```python
import panel as pn
from transformers_agent_ui import TransformersAgentUI

pn.extension("terminal", "notifications", notifications=True, design="bootstrap")

TransformersAgentUI()
```

To serve as a web app create the file `app.py`

```python
import panel as pn
from transformers_agent_ui import TransformersAgentUI

if pn.state.served:
    pn.extension("terminal", "notifications", notifications=True, design="bootstrap")
    TransformersAgentUI().servable()
```

and run

```bash
BOKEH_RESOURCES=cdn panel serve app.py
```

In order for you to run the inference you will have to provide tokens. Preferably via the
environment variables

- `HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN`
- `OPEN_AI_TOKEN`

Alternatively you can provide them on the *Settings tab* in the app.

## üöÄ Get started in under a minute

Install `transformers-agent-ui` including the *`examples` dependencies*.

```bash
pip install  transformers-agent-ui[examples]
```

Explore the sample apps

```bash
pn hello transformers-agent-ui
```

## Todo List

- [x] Implement TokenManager
- [ ] Redirect log to Terminal AND to stdout for easier debugging
- [x] Save every run - also when cache is hit
- [ ] Add three examples to make it easy to get started
- [x] Add notification if no token is available
- [ ] Deploy to Pypi
- [ ] Deploy to Hugging Face
- [ ] Support dynamic arguments (text, image etc) to run function
- [ ] Multi user support
  - [ ] Restrict logs to user session
  - [ ] Restrict store to user session
- [ ] Don't save asset if from cache. Instead reuse.
- [ ] Save run prints to logs
- [ ] Support `remote` parameter setting
- [ ] Support `return_code` parameter setting
- [ ] Run inference async to make app more performant if possible
- [ ] Make the Cache/ Store useful by providing an interface
- [ ] Add specific support for reading and writing more types. Currently most things are pickled.
