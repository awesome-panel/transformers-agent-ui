# ü§ó Transformers Agent UI

THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY A PROOF OF CONCEPT. DON'T EXPECT EVERYTHING TO WORK! CHECK OUT THE
[TODO LIST](#todo-list) FOR MORE INFO.

We want to

- Make it easy to use the [Hugging Face Transformers Agent](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/transformers_agents).

We provide

- the `TransformersAgentUI` component which can be used in the notebook as a web app
- a deployment of the web app on Hugging Face Spaces

You can install and use the package as simple as.

```bash
pip install transformers-agent-ui
```

In a notebook just run

```python
import panel as pn
from transformers_agent_ui import TransformersAgentUI

pn.extension("terminal", "notifications", notifications=True, design="bootstrap")

TransformersAgentUI()
```

To serve as a web app create the file `app.py`

```python
import panel as pn
from transformers_agent_ui import TransformersAgentUI

if pn.state.served:
    pn.extension("terminal", "notifications", notifications=True, design="bootstrap")
    TransformersAgentUI().servable()
```

and run

```bash
BOKEH_RESOURCES=cdn panel serve app.py
```

In order for you to run the inference you will have to provide tokens. Preferably via the
environment variables

- `HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN`
- `OPEN_AI_TOKEN`

Alternatively you can provide them on the *Settings tab* in the app.

## üöÄ Get started in under a minute

Install `transformers-agent-ui` including the *`examples` dependencies*.

```bash
pip install  transformers-agent-ui[examples]
```

Explore the sample apps

```bash
pn hello transformers-agent-ui
```

<!-- ![Project Intro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awesome-panel/transformers-agent-ui/main/assets/videos/pn-hello-transformers-agent-ui.gif) -->

You can now find the *reference* and *gallery* notebooks in the `examples/awesome-panel/transformers-agent-ui` folder. Check them out by running `jupyter lab`.

## Todo List

- [x] Implement TokenManager
- [x] Save every run - also when cache is hit
- [x] Add notification if no token is available
- [x] Deploy to Pypi. DONE - See [link](https://pypi.org/project/transformers-agent-ui/)
- [x] Rename `running` parameter to `is_running` parameter
- [x] Move use_cache from settings tab to editor tab
- [x] Save run prints to store
- [ ] Redirect log to Terminal AND to stdout for easier debugging
- [ ] Support dynamic arguments (text, image etc) to run function
  - [x] As inputs to .run
  - [ ] Create/ Update from file
  - [ ] Create/ Update from output
  - [ ] Delete/ Remove
- [ ] Get better feedback on run exceptions back
- [ ] Test it on lots of examples
  - [ ] Add specific support for reading and writing more types. Currently most things are pickled.
- [ ] Add three examples to make it easy to get started
- [ ] Support enabled `remote` parameter setting. Currently we only support `remote`.
- [ ] Don't save asset if from cache. Instead reuse.
- [ ] Make the Cache/ Store useful by providing an interface
- [ ] Multi user support
  - [ ] Restrict logs to user session
    - See also [hf #23354](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/23354)
  - [ ] Restrict store to user session
- [ ] Deploy to Hugging Face
- [ ] Build a sample store and collect data on runs
- [ ] Enable downloading the output value
- [ ] Help the app and/ or Panel display the outputs. For example when a tensor is returned Panel
does not know how to display that. And the agent fails if we ask it to return the value wrapped in
a HoloViz Panel Audio Pane. See [Panel #4836](https://github.com/holoviz/panel/issues/4836)

## Maybe list

- [ ] Make the project more specific by calling it hfagent-ui and providing HFAgentUI,
- [ ] Make the project more general as in agent-ui. We could provide HFAgentUI,
LangChainAgentUI etc. Or maybe even just AgentUI. Much of the code would be reusable.
- [ ] Run inference async to make app more performant if possible
